    The input graph is given in either a Pythonic way as the *adjacency* parameter
    or in the direct C-like way that Metis likes as *xadj* and *adjncy*. It
    is an error to specify both graph inputs.

    The Pythonic graph specifier *adjacency* is required to have the following
    properties:

    - len(adjacency) needs to return the number of vertices
    - ``adjacency[i]`` needs to be an iterable of vertices adjacent to vertex i.
      Both directions of an undirected graph edge are required to be stored.

    If you would like to use *eweights* (edge weights), you need to use the
    xadj/adjncy way of specifying graph connectivity. This works as follows:

        The adjacency structure of the graph is stored as follows: The
        adjacency list of vertex *i* is stored in array *adjncy* starting at
        index ``xadj[i]`` and ending at (but not including) index ``xadj[i +
        1]``. That is, for each vertex i, its adjacency list is stored in
        consecutive locations in the array *adjncy*, and the array *xadj* is
        used to point to where it begins and where it ends.

        The weights of the edges (if any) are stored in an additional array
        called *eweights*. This array contains *2m* elements (where *m* is the
        number of edges, taking into account the undirected nature of the
        graph), and the weight of edge ``adjncy[j]`` is stored at location
        ``adjwgt[j]``. The edge-weights must be integers greater than zero. If
        all the edges of the graph have the same weight (i.e., the graph is
        unweighted), then the adjwgt can be set to ``None``.

    METIS runtime options can be specified by supplying an Options object in
    the input.
